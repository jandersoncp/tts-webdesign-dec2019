	<h2>Some quick facts:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>javaScript runs on the client side AND the server side (but we will use it exclusively on the client side</li>
		<li>Variables are declared with var. All statements in JS end with a semicolon.</li>
		<li>When loading a script, always load before the closing body tag. If loaded in the head, it will block all resources on the page from loading until the javascript has loaded. This will slow down your browser tremedously.</li>
	</ul>

	<!-- Pull in the script before the closing body tag -->
